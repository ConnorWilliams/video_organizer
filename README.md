## Usage

### GUI Application
1. **Launch the app** from your Applications folder
2. **Select source directory** containing your skydiving videos
3. **Configure settings**:
   - Video extensions (default: .mp4, .mov, .MP4, .MOV)
   - Jump time threshold (default: 20 minutes)
   - Preserve original names (optional)
4. **Click "Organize Videos"** to start processing
5. **Monitor progress** in the log output



## File Organization

Videos are organized into a structured hierarchy:

```
Source Directory/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ organized/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Jump 1 - Video 1 - HH-MM (original_name).mp4
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Jump 1 - Video 2 - HH-MM (original_name).mp4
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Jump 2 - Video 1 - HH-MM (original_name).mp4
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Naming Convention
- **Date folders**: `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **Jump grouping**: Videos recorded within the time threshold are grouped as the same jump
- **Video numbering**: Sequential numbering within each jump
- **Time stamp**: Recording time in HH-MM format
- **Original name**: Preserved in parentheses (optional)

## Configuration

### Video Extensions
Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.MP4`, `.MOV`
Add more extensions in the GUI.

### Jump Time Threshold
Default: 20 minutes
Videos recorded within this time window are considered part of the same jump.

### Name Preservation
When enabled, original filenames are preserved in parentheses:
- `Jump 1 - Video 1 - 14-30 (GOPR1234).mp4`
- `Jump 1 - Video 1 - 14-30 (My awesome skydive).mp4`

When disabled, clean names are used:
- `Jump 1 - Video 1 - 14-30.mp4`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't open on macOS:**
- Right-click the app and select "Open"
- Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and allow the app

**Videos not being organized:**
- Check that the source directory exists and contains video files
- Verify video file extensions are supported
- Check the log output for error messages

**Wrong dates detected:**
- The app uses file creation/modification times
- For GoPro files with incorrect timestamps, the app will prompt for manual correction

**Duplicate files:**
- The app uses file hashing to prevent duplicates
- Check the log for "already exists" messages
